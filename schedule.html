<li><p>Project implementation</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You must use git repository for the work on the project, making frequent enough commits so that the project group (and course staff) can follow the progress.</p>
<p>The completed project work will be demonstrated to the group’s advisor at a demo session. The final demonstrations are arranged on week 50 (7.-11.12.). After the final demonstrations project group evaluates another project, and self-evaluates own project. In addition, project members will give confidential individual assessment of each group member</p>
<p>The course staff should be able to easily compile the project work using makefile and related instructions provided in the git repository. The final output should be in the master branch of the git repository.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Working practices</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Each project group is assigned an advisor from the project teaching personnel. There will be a dedicated Teams channel for each group, to facilitate discussion between the group and advisor. Group should meet with advisor weekly. The weekly meeting does not need to be long if there are no special issues to discuss, and can be taken remotely as voice/video chat on the group Teams channel (or Zoom or other similar tool), preferably at a regular weekly time. In the meeting the group updates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What each member has done during the week</p></li>
<li><p>Are there challenges or problems? Discuss the possible solutions</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for the next week for everyone</p></li>
<li><p>Deviations and changes to the project plan, if any</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is understood that note everyone may not be able to participate to all meetings, but at least a couple of members should be present in each meeting. Regular absence from meetings will affect in individual evaluation.</p>
