DOCUMENTATION
==============


- Project documentation
	
	The actual project documentation is stored in the doc/ folder in the Git repository. It should be formatted similarly to the project plan, and also be in PDF format. Separate PDF document needs to be provided also if your project uses Doxygen for inline documentation.

	The deadline for project documentation and the project source code is Friday, December 11 at 23:59. No commits to git should be made after this.


- The document should contain the following parts:

1. Overview: 
		
	what the software does, 
		
	what it doesn't do? (this can be taken/updated from the project plan)
	
	
2. Software structure: 
		
	overall architecture, 
	
	class relationships (diagram very strongly recommended), 
		
	interfaces to external libraries
	
	
3. Instructions for building and using the software:
	
	How to compile the program ('make' should be sufficient), as taken from git repository. If external libraries are needed, describe the requirements here
	
	How to use the software: a basic user guide
	
	
4. Testing: 
		
	how the different modules in software were tested, description of the methods and outcomes
	
	
5. Work log:
	
	Detailed description of division of work and everyone's responsibilities
	
	For each week, description of what was done and roughly how many hours were used, for each project member
